# General Infos

The SOS-SES-Feeder acts as an [SOS](https://github.com/52North/SOS/)
to [SES](https://github.com/52North/SES/) feeding bridge. It creates a
notification stream for a Sensor Event Service based on the standardized
[OGC SOS interface](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos).

Currently only [SOS standard version 1.0.0](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos)
is supported.
